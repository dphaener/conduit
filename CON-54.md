Implement 'conduit introspect resources' Command

ðŸŽ¯ Business Context & Purpose

Problem: Developers need a quick way to see all resources in their application. This is the entry point for introspection - the "what exists?" question.

Business Value: This is the most frequently used command (projected 80% usage). Fast, scannable output increases developer productivity.

User Impact: Developers can instantly see all resources without opening files or searching through code.

ðŸ“‹ Expected Behavior/Outcome

Command: conduit introspect resources

Default Output (scannable summary):

RESOURCES (12 total)

Core Resources:
User 8 fields 2 relationships 1 hook âœ“ auth required
Post 15 fields 3 relationships 2 hooks âœ“ cached
Comment 6 fields 2 relationships 1 hook âœ“ nested

Administrative:
Category 4 fields 1 relationship - -
Tag 3 fields - - -

With --verbose: Show all fields, relationships, middleware per resource

With --format json: Machine-readable JSON for tooling

âœ… Acceptance Criteria
