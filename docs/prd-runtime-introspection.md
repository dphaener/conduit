# Conduit Runtime & Introspection System PRD

## Context & Why Now

The software development industry faces a fundamental impediment: LLMs generate code probabilistically from training data rather than deterministically from actual codebases. Current LLM code generation shows 60% pattern adherence, requires 3-5 iterations to get right, and patterns drift inconsistently over time. This creates a trust deficit where developers spend more time correcting AI-generated code than writing it themselves.

The Conduit Runtime & Introspection System transforms this paradigm by making codebases fully queryable and self-documenting at runtime. Instead of guessing patterns, LLMs query exact patterns in THIS codebase, achieving 95%+ pattern adherence in 1-2 iterations with self-correction capabilities.

Market timing is optimal:
- LLM adoption in development workflows crossed 75% in 2024 (Source — GitHub Copilot usage stats)
- Enterprises demand deterministic AI code generation for compliance (Source — Gartner 2024 AI governance report)
- Developer productivity tools market growing 23% YoY to $31B by 2026 (Source — IDC DevTools forecast)

## Open Questions

1. Should introspection be enabled by default in production?
   - **Recommendation:** Default off, explicit opt-in for security

2. Binary vs JSON format for metadata?
   - **Recommendation:** JSON for v1 (debuggable), binary for v2 (performance)

3. How to handle versioning as schema evolves?
   - **Recommendation:** Semantic versioning with backward compatibility

4. Real-time pattern updates vs compilation-time only?
   - **Recommendation:** Compilation-time for v1, consider real-time for v2

5. Integration with external documentation systems?
   - **Recommendation:** Export API for v1.1, not critical path
